**Speecific Pages**
Settings>Preferences:

By letting users choose how they want to learn and receive feedback, the app acknowledges that different salespeople have different learning styles and preferences.
These learning methods include structured, flexible, Challenge-based, etc. 
accessible from settings. People's preferences change as they use the system, and having to reset onboarding to adjust these settings creates friction.
The training styles could benefit from brief examples or descriptions. For instance, what exactly does "Challenge-based" mean compared to "Structured"?
The feedback frequency options are useful, but users might not understand the implications of each choice during onboarding. For example, "Real-time" feedback might interrupt the flow of conversation but provide immediate guidance.
I think these preference controls would work well as part of an accessible settings panel that users can adjust anytime, with the onboarding just setting initial defaults. This would maintain the personalization aspect while making the app more adaptable to changing user needs.
