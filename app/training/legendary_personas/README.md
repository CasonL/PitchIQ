## Technical Implementation

### Creating a New Persona

1. Create a new directory in `personas/` for your character
2. Define the persona's configuration, animations, and sound effects
3. Implement any custom visual elements or UI components
4. Register with the persona loader

### Persona Configuration Format

```javascript
{
  "id": "coin_flip_carl",
  "name": "Coin-Flip Carl",
  "description": "Makes all decisions by flipping a coin",
  "traits": {
    "impulsiveness": 9,
    "indecisiveness": 10,
    "enthusiasm": 8,
    "humor": 7
  },
  "visualElements": {
    "coinFlip": {
      "animation": "coin_flip",
      "trigger": "decision_point",
      "sound": "coin_flip_sound"
    }
  },
  "voice": {
    "type": "male",
    "pace": 7,
    "pitch": 5
  },
  "responsePatterns": [
    "Let me flip on that...",
    "The coin says {result}!",
    "Heads we do it, tails we don't."
  ],
  "shareableEvents": [
    "major_decision_flip",
    "contradictory_advice"
  ]
}
```

### Integration with Voice Interface

The Legendary Personas system enhances the standard chat interface by:

1. Intercepting normal conversation flows to inject persona-specific moments
2. Rendering custom visual elements and animations based on conversation context
3. Playing appropriate sound effects timed with animations
4. Creating and surfacing shareable moments for users to capture

### Animation System

Animations are managed through a sophisticated system that:

1. Supports complex, multi-stage animations (like the coin flip perspective effect)
2. Synchronizes animations with audio playback
3. Responds to conversation state and context
4. Creates visually distinctive and memorable moments

## Usage Example

```javascript
// Example of initializing a Legendary Persona
import { loadPersona } from '../core/persona_loader.js';
import { initAnimations } from '../core/animation_manager.js';
import { initAudio } from '../shared/audio/sound_effects.js';

// Load Coin-Flip Carl
const coinFlipCarl = await loadPersona('coin_flip_carl');

// Initialize animation and audio systems
initAnimations(coinFlipCarl.visualElements);
initAudio(coinFlipCarl.sounds);

// Generate response with persona characteristics
function handleUserMessage(message) {
  // Check for decision point in the conversation
  if (isDecisionPoint(message)) {
    // Trigger the coin flip animation and sound
    triggerVisualElement('coinFlip');
    
    // Wait for animation to complete
    await waitForAnimation();
    
    // Get the result and create response
    const flipResult = getRandomResult(['heads', 'tails']);
    return generatePersonaResponse(message, flipResult);
  }
  
  // Handle normal conversation
  return generateStandardResponse(message);
}
```

## Sharing & Virality Features

The framework includes built-in features to encourage viral sharing:

- **Screenshot-Ready Moments**: Visually distinctive elements designed for sharing
- **Shareable Recap Cards**: Auto-generated summary images of memorable interactions
- **GIF Capture**: Ability to record short animations of key moments
