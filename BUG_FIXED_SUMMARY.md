# üêõ Bug Fixed: A/B Test Feature Ready

## ‚úÖ Issue Resolved

**Problem**: Getting 500 Internal Server Error when clicking smart fill
```
AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'strip'
```

**Root Cause**: The personalization route was passing `None` values from the database to the persona service, which expected strings.

**Fix Applied**: Added null coalescing operators (`or ''`) to ensure empty strings instead of None values:
```python
persona_context = {
    'core_q1_product': user_profile.p_product or '',
    'core_q1_value': user_profile.p_value_prop or '',
    'core_q2_audience': user_profile.p_audience or '',
    # ... etc
}
```
