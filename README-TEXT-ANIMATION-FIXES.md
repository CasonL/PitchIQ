# Text Animation Fixes

This document outlines the fixes implemented to address the issue where text animations restart when keys are pressed.

## Problem

The StreamingText and StreamingTextDirect components were restarting or stopping animations whenever:
- The user pressed a key
- The window focus changed
- The component re-rendered for other reasons

## Root Causes

1. **Ineffective Debouncing**: The content comparison wasn't properly normalized, leading to unnecessary re-renders
2. **Dependency Array Issues**: Using `JSON.stringify(conversationHistory)` in dependency array caused recreation on every render
3. **Missing Focus Handling**: Component didn't properly handle window focus/blur events
4. **No Animation State Tracking**: No flag to track if animation was already in progress

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. StreamingTextDirect Component

- **Stable Refs**: Added refs to track message, history, and context to prevent reactive dependencies
  ```typescript
  const messageRef = useRef<string>('');
  const historyRef = useRef<string>('');
  const additionalContextRef = useRef<string>('');
  ```

- **Animation State Tracking**: Added a flag to prevent restarting already running animations
  ```typescript
  const isStreamingRef = useRef<boolean>(false);
  ```

- **Memoized Connection Function**: Used `useCallback` to create a stable connection function
  ```typescript
  const connectToStream = useCallback(() => {
    // Only start if not already streaming
    if (isStreamingRef.current) return;
    // ...
  }, []); // No dependencies
  ```

- **Improved Cleanup**: Better cleanup for all timers and connections

### 2. StreamingText Component

- **Enhanced Content Normalization**: Aggressive content normalization to prevent unnecessary rerenders
  ```typescript
  const normalizedContent = content.trim().replace(/\s+/g, ' ');
  ```

- **Improved Debouncing**: 300ms debounce delay before parsing content
  ```typescript
  contentDebounceTimerRef.current = window.setTimeout(() => {
    // Parse content and start animation
  }, 300);
  ```

- **Focus/Blur Handling**: Added event listeners to prevent animation restart on window focus changes
  ```typescript
  window.addEventListener('blur', handleBlurFocus);
  window.addEventListener('focus', handleBlurFocus);
  ```

- **Animation State Tracking**: Added isProcessingRef to track animation state

### 3. Demo Component Improvements

- **Input Focus Management**: Return focus to input after animation completes
- **Tab Switching Control**: Disabled tab switching during animations
- **Immediate Input Clearing**: Clear input immediately to prevent multiple sends
- **Send State Tracking**: Added sendingRef to prevent duplicate messages

## CSS Improvements

- **Layout Jitter Prevention**: Added CSS fixes to reduce layout shifts
  ```css
  animation-delay: 10ms; /* Small delay to reduce layout jitter */
  min-width: 100%; /* Prevent layout jitter */
  ```

- **Better Content Chunking**: Improved content chunking to handle long paragraphs better
  ```typescript
  // Split by both word count and character length
  splitLongSentence(sentence, 60);
  ```
