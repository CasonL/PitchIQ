# AI Text Streaming Enhancement

This implementation enhances the text animation in two key ways:

1. **Fixing UI issues in StreamingText component**
2. **Adding direct token streaming from the API**

## Approach 1: Better Animation in StreamingText

The StreamingText component has been enhanced with several fixes:
- Added animation delay to prevent layout jitter
- Improved debouncing to prevent restarting animations during typing
- Fixed CSS issues with visibility and positioning
- Added better content chunking for more natural paragraph breaks

## Approach 2: Direct Token Streaming

A more advanced approach has been implemented with:
- Backend streaming API endpoint using Server-Sent Events (SSE)
- Modified OpenAI/Anthropic prompting for more natural responses
- Specialized StreamingTextDirect component for real-time token display

## Components Added

1. **Backend Streaming**
   - `app/openai_service.py`: Added `generate_streaming_response` method
   - `app/routes/api/dashboard.py`: Added `/coach/stream` endpoint using SSE

2. **Frontend Components**
   - `app/frontend/src/lib/StreamingTextDirect.tsx`: Real-time streaming component
   - `app/frontend/src/components/chat/StreamingDemo.tsx`: Demo comparing both approaches

3. **Demo Route**
   - `app/routes/__init__.py`: Added demo blueprint
   - `app/templates/demo/streaming_demo.html`: HTML template for demo page

## How to Test

Visit `/demo/streaming-demo` to see a comparison between:
- Traditional animation (text appears with simulated typing)
- Direct token streaming (text appears as generated by the API)

## API Considerations

The streaming API endpoint:
- Delivers chunks as they're generated by the AI
- Uses the Server-Sent Events protocol
- Includes intentionally variable timing for a more natural feel

## Further Improvements

Future enhancements could include:
- Smarter sentence/paragraph chunking in the streaming response
- Adding typing indicators during generation
- Voice streaming synchronized with text streaming
