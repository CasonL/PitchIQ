## PitchIQ is what we are building. it is a sales training system with multiple layers. 

### the macro: 
PitchIQ is designed to democrotize sales training so the average person can have access to quality sales training. This promotes healthy entrepreneurial pursuits, giving power back to the people. 

PitchIQ's long-term goal, is to provide people a benchmark to practice and put on their resumes, allowing companies to see talent more clearly. 

My (Cason) passion with this project, is to fuel canada first with the means to build things, and spark philantropy and give back to communities. This will help canada recover. 

PitchIQ attempts to jump past the rest and create experiences with quality calls, and groundbreaking voice-first UI/UX designs that keep people learning and coming back.

### The micro: 
PitchIQ has an AI coach, and a generated persona that the user can spar with. the coach gets a summary of each call, and the knowledge about the user's skills increases over time, allowing for a more tailored training program for individuals and businesses. The generated persona generates fresh based on the users business, target market, and other factors. 


#PitchIQ's brand: 
minimalist, white, bold reds, blacks, round corners, innovative. 
PitchIQ designs each page so the background is slightly darker than cards/text, and buttons or whatever is on top is/are the brightest.

PitchIQ is trustworthy, a friend. It's everything the average entrepreneur needs to sell their ideas. its professional, and goofy enough to keep people smiling.
