# A/B Test: Animated Coaching Feature - Test Guide

## üéØ What We Built

A theatrical, animated coaching experience that appears when users click "Smart Fill" - **only for 50% of users** (A/B test).

## üöÄ Testing Instructions

### 1. **Access the Feature**
- Go to `http://localhost:5173/meet-your-coach`
- Look for the "Smart Fill" button in the Enhance Coach panel (right side)

### 2. **A/B Test Groups**
- **Group A (Animated)**: Gets the coaching bubble with typing animation
- **Group B (Regular)**: Gets standard smart fill behavior
- Assignment is random on page load (50/50 split)

### 3. **Animated Experience (Group A)**
When you click "Smart Fill":
1. **Immediate**: Coaching bubble appears above button
2. **1.5 seconds**: "COACH:" label appears
3. **Typing animation**: Message types out character by character with sound
4. **Message**: "Nice try, but top performers know their pitch cold. Think you can beat the AI? Here's your starting point..."
5. **Auto-dismiss**: Bubble disappears after 3 seconds
6. **Smart fill executes**: Fields get populated

### 4. **What to Test**

#### ‚úÖ **Visual Elements**
- [ ] Bubble appears with smooth animation
- [ ] Speech arrow points to button correctly
- [ ] Text has proper styling (COACH: in red, message in white)
- [ ] Bubble auto-dismisses after full sequence

#### ‚úÖ **Timing & Animation**
- [ ] 1.5 second pause before typing starts
- [ ] Typing animation is smooth (30ms per character)
- [ ] Cursor blinks realistically
- [ ] Sound effects play (subtle typing sounds)

#### ‚úÖ **Functionality**
- [ ] Smart fill still works correctly after animation
- [ ] Fields get populated with AI-generated content
- [ ] No interference with form functionality
- [ ] Button remains responsive

#### ‚úÖ **Analytics Tracking**
Check browser console for these events:
- [ ] `smart_fill_ab_test_assigned` (on page load)
- [ ] `smart_fill_clicked` (when button pressed)
- [ ] `coaching_animation_shown` (for Group A only)
- [ ] `coaching_animation_completed` (when typing finishes)
- [ ] `smart_fill_completed` (when API succeeds)

### 5. **Force Group Assignment** (for testing)
To test both experiences, modify the A/B assignment in the browser console:

```javascript
// Force animated experience
localStorage.setItem('force_ab_group', 'animated');

// Force regular experience  
localStorage.setItem('force_ab_group', 'regular');

// Remove forcing (back to random)
localStorage.removeItem('force_ab_group');

// Then refresh the page
```

## üé® Design Details

### Bubble Styling
- Dark background (`bg-gray-900`)
- Red accent for "COACH:" label
- Professional speech bubble arrow
- Smooth scale/fade animations
- Proper z-index layering

### Sound Effects
- Subtle typing sounds using Web Audio API
- Non-intrusive, adds to theatrical effect
- Graceful fallback if audio fails

### Performance
- No animations block user interaction
- Lightweight implementation
- Smooth 60fps animations

## üìä Success Metrics

Track these conversions between groups:
1. **Smart Fill Completion Rate**: Do more people complete smart fill in animated group?
2. **Enhance Button Clicks**: Does the animation lead to more coach enhancements?
3. **User Engagement**: Time spent on page, form interactions
4. **Bounce Rate**: Does animation improve or hurt retention?

## üêõ Known Issues & Edge Cases

- [ ] Audio might not work on some browsers (graceful fallback)
- [ ] Animation might overlap if button clicked rapidly (prevented)
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness of speech bubble
- [ ] Screen reader accessibility

## üîß Configuration

The A/B test can be easily modified in `MeetYourCoachPage.tsx`:

```typescript
// Change split ratio
const abTestValue = Math.random() < 0.3; // 30% get animated

// Modify message
setCoachMessage("Your custom coaching message here...");

// Adjust timing
setTimeout(() => setIsTyping(true), 2000); // 2 second delay
```
