# Database Schema Fix Report

## Overview
This report documents the database schema fixes applied to resolve several issues with the application. The primary problems were related to missing columns in the `training_session`, `user_profile`, and `buyer_persona` tables, as well as a missing `conversation` table.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Training Session Table
- **Issue**: Missing `reached_stages` and `current_stage` columns needed for conversation stage tracking
- **Fix**: Added columns to support tracking which stages a sales conversation has reached and the current active stage
- **Script**: `add_columns.py`

### 2. User Profile Table
- **Issue**: Missing columns including `onboarding_step`, `onboarding_step_new`, and many others
- **Fix**: Added 23 missing columns to the user_profile table to support various user profile attributes
- **Script**: `add_user_profile_columns.py`

### 3. Sales Stage Table
- **Issue**: Missing table needed for customizable sales process stages
- **Fix**: Created the `sales_stage` table with 5 default stages (rapport, discovery, pitch, objection_handling, closing)
- **Script**: `add_columns.py`

### 4. Conversation Table
- **Issue**: Missing table referred to in the auto-cleanup process
- **Fix**: Created the `conversation` table with appropriate schema
- **Script**: `create_conversation_table.py`

### 5. Buyer Persona Table
- **Issue**: Missing columns required for storing buyer persona attributes
- **Fix**: Added missing columns including `personality_traits`, `emotional_state`, `buyer_type`, `decision_authority`, `industry_context`, `objections`, and `cognitive_biases`
- **Script**: `fix_buyer_persona_table.py`

## Configuration Changes
- Updated `config.py` to point to the modified database file (`sales_training.db.bak`)

## Testing
The changes were tested using the `test_queries.py` script, which verified:
1. All required columns exist in the user_profile table
2. All required columns exist in the training_session table
3. The sales_stage table exists with proper default values
4. The conversation table exists and can be queried

## Conclusion
All identified database schema issues have been resolved. The application should now be able to:
- Track conversation stages during roleplays
- Display session summaries with stage-appropriate metrics
- Support the sales stage settings page functionality
- Run auto-cleanup processes without errors
- Generate and store buyer personas with all required attributes

If additional schema issues are discovered, a similar approach can be used to identify and fix the problems.
