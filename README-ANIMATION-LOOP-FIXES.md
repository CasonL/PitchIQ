# Animation Loop Fixes

This document outlines the fixes implemented to address issues with text animation loops in both the StreamingText and StreamingTextDirect components.

## Problems Identified

1. **Animation Loop After Completion**: Animations would restart after completion
2. **Multiple Active Animations**: Multiple animation cycles could run simultaneously
3. **Completion State Issues**: Completion callbacks were called incorrectly
4. **Race Conditions**: State updates could overlap between different animations

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. StreamingTextDirect Component

- **Fixed Completion Logic**: Removed problematic condition that prevented onComplete from being called
  ```javascript
  // Before (problematic)
  if (currentRequestId === requestIdRef.current && onComplete && !isCompletedRef.current) {
    onComplete();
  }
  
  // After (fixed)
  if (currentRequestId === requestIdRef.current && onComplete) {
    onComplete();
  }
  ```

- **Request ID Tracking**: Added proper tracking of request IDs to ensure only the most current request updates the state

### 2. StreamingText Component

- **Animation Counter**: Added a counter to track and invalidate old animations
  ```javascript
  const animationCountRef = useRef<number>(0);
  
  // Increment on new animation
  animationCountRef.current += 1;
  const currentAnimationId = animationCountRef.current;
  
  // Check before updating state
  if (animationCountRef.current === currentAnimationId) {
    // Safe to update state
  }
  ```

- **Explicit Reset Function**: Added a dedicated reset function to ensure clean state transitions
  ```javascript
  const resetAnimation = useCallback(() => {
    clearTimer();
    // Reset all state and counters
    animationCountRef.current += 1;
  }, []);
  ```

- **Content Change Detection**: Added explicit check for content changes to trigger resets
  ```javascript
  if (content !== prevContentRef.current) {
    resetAnimation();
  }
  ```

### 3. StreamingDemo Component

- **Response Keys**: Added unique keys to StreamingText components to force clean re-renders
  ```javascript
  <StreamingText 
    content={lastResponse} 
    onComplete={handleResponseComplete}
    key={`streaming-text-${responseIdRef.current}`} // Force re-render on new responses
  />
  ```

- **Improved Conversation Updates**: Better handling of conversation state updates to prevent duplicate messages

## Testing

To verify the fixes:
1. Send multiple messages in succession - each should animate only once
2. Try typing during animation - it should continue without restarting
3. Switch focus away and back to the window - animation should continue normally
4. After animation completes, no additional animations should start

These fixes ensure that:
- Each animation runs exactly once
- Multiple animations don't overlap
- State is properly tracked between animation cycles
- Race conditions are eliminated
