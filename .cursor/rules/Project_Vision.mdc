# project vision

## SYSTEM OVERVIEW:
Build a modular, LLM-based AI trainer that includes:
1. **User Profile Engine**: Collects and stores user context (experience, product, target market, struggles, mindset).
2. **Roleplay Engine**: Simulates dynamic, psychologically intelligent buyer personas tailored to the user's profile.
3. **Feedback Engine**: Analyzes performance, identifies key moments, and provides structured coaching through visuals, graphs, and psychological models.
4. modern, dark designs with prop

## 1. ONBOARDING PHASE (User Profile Engine):
- Create a multi-turn conversation flow to gather:
  - Sales experience level
  - Product/service they sell
  - Target audience (B2B, B2C, both)
  - Industry or niche
  - Pain points / areas of struggle
  - Recent wins or highlights
  - Mindset challenges (confidence, fear of rejection, etc.)
  - Personal goals for improvement
- Store all responses in a persistent user profile object.
- Use this profile to adjust future simulations and feedback.

## 2. ROLEPLAY PHASE (Roleplay Simulation Engine):
- Dynamically generate buyer personas using 50+ attributes:
  - Personality traits (e.g., skeptical, expressive, logical)
  - Emotions (e.g., cautious, frustrated, curious)
  - Buyer type (economic, technical, user)
  - Role and decision authority
  - Pain points and objections
  - Industry-specific context (e.g., SaaS, finance, retail)
- Tailor objections and tone based on user profile:
  - If user is weak at handling objections, introduce controlled resistance
  - If user needs confidence training, balance challenge with positive reinforcement
- Simulate cognitive biases:
  - Anchoring, scarcity, loss aversion, social proof, commitment, reciprocity
- Track and log key interaction points:
  - Objections raised and handled
  - Rapport-building moments
  - Persuasion tactics used

## 3. FEEDBACK PHASE (Interactive Dashboard Engine):
Build an output interface with the following structured components:

### a. Performance Summary
- Win/loss status
- Buyer trust score
- Persuasion rating (based on use of psychology)

### b. Key Moment Analyzer
- Extract and label turning points (positive/negative)
- Generate snippet playback markers (text or timestamp-based)
- Highlight phrases that gained or lost trust

### c. Cognitive Bias Map
- Detect which biases were used (or missed)
- Rate effectiveness (1-10 scale)

### d. Objection Radar
- Categorize all objections raised (price, trust, urgency, timing)
- Grade response quality with suggestions

### e. Emotional Tone & Confidence Graph
- Assess vocal or text tone consistency
- Confidence score over call duration (visual timeline)

### f. Mindset Coaching Layer
- Identify negative self-talk or limiting phrases
- Suggest reframes and affirmations
- Offer meditation prompts or focus resets

### g. Progress Tracker
- Show improvements across skill areas over time
- Track objection handling growth, rapport-building, use of sales psychology
- Include motivational quotes or positive reinforcement based on progress
