## Voice First Architecture Rule

When working on features related to voice interaction, refer to the following OpenAI documentation for architectural guidance:

- [OpenAI Voice Agent Architecture Guide](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/voice-agents?voice-agent-architecture=speech-to-speech)

This rule applies to files within `app/voice/`, `app/services/voice_analysis_service.py`, and other related modules handling voice input, processing, or output.
